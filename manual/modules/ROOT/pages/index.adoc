== Definition

In navigation, dead reckoning or dead-reckoning (also ded for deduced
reckoning or *DR*) is the process of calculating one's current
*position* by using a previously determined *position*, or fix, and
advancing that *position* based upon known or estimated speeds over
elapsed time and course.

== 1. What and Why

The DR plugin is a means of adding DR positions to a route. Because the
plugin cannot access 'Route Manager' directly it works by editing a gpx
file, which has been exported from 'Route Manager'.

DR speed and the time between the DR positions can be changed before the
DR gpx is finally created.

This plugin is a temporary solution to the problem of creating DR
positions. The *Draw plugin* now allows the creation of DR positions for
course legs.

== 2. Install

Copy 'DR_pi.dll' to the plugins folder. Start OpenCPN. Tools/Options and
select 'Enable' for the DR entry.

== 3. Standard actions

Save the route which you want to add DR positions to by using 'Route
Manager'. Make a note of the folder where this original route file can
be found.

Start DR:

The main page of the plugin appears:

The DR speed and interval between DR positions have been added. The DR
route name is entered in the bottom box.

The process of creating the DR route is started by pressing 'Generate
GPX'. A file dialog box appears.

Select the route GPX file where DR positions will be added.

Immediately after selecting this file a new file dialog box appears.

After pressing 'Save' the route_dr gpx file is created in the folder you
have chosen. If the original file is not needed you can use the same
file name and the original file will be over-written.

The plugin can now be closed.

Using 'Route Manager' import the DR gpx:

The DR route is now available. To avoid confusion the original route can
be hidden by using the 'Eye' symbol.
